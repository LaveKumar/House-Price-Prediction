## House Price Prediction Using Boston Housing Dataset
This project leverages the Boston Housing Dataset to predict house prices using various regression techniques. It is designed to showcase the application of machine learning models to a real-world problem, emphasizing feature analysis, model evaluation, and deployment-readiness.

## Key Features
* Dataset Overview:

    * Utilized the Boston Housing Dataset, containing features like crime rate, property tax rate, and proximity to employment centers.
    * Preprocessed and cleaned the data to ensure high-quality inputs for modeling.

* Regression Models Implemented:

    * Linear Regression
    * Ridge Regression
    * Lasso Regression
    * Polynomial Regression
    * Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor for comparison

* Feature Engineering:

    * Analyzed feature importance and correlation with target prices.
    * Applied standardization and normalization techniques for better model performance.

* Model Evaluation:

    * Evaluated models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score.
    * Visualized performance using residual plots and comparison graphs.
Insights Gained:

    * Identified key factors affecting house prices in the Boston area.
Demonstrated the importance of regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) to prevent overfitting.

* Tools and Technologies Used:

    * Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data processing, modeling, and visualization.
    * Jupyter Notebook for code experimentation and analysis.

* Future Enhancements:

    * Explore more advanced models like XGBoost and LightGBM for better predictions.
    * Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Streamlit for real-world usability.
